      <h1 class="mb-4 text-center">Description of Data</h1>

      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-center">Journals By Discipline</h4>
      <p>Each journal is classified as belonging to one, and only one, discipline. Disciplines were derived from the original three-level classification system from 1Science/Science-Metrix using Domain-->Field-->Subfield. The original Science-Metrix classification had 6 domains, 22 fields, and 176 subfields; we have attempted to map the Fields more closely to areas of study at UVA. These resulting “disciplines” were formed from the Fields by adding or removing Subfields. There are 20 mutually exclusive disciplines.
      Interdisciplinary journals can be challenging to locate in this discipline hierarchy; therefore, we have provided a 'Find my journal' search button within the Journals by Discipline tool.</p>

      <h5 class="text-center my-4"></b>Metrics</b></h5>
      <p><b>Downloads</b> - Individual article downloads (PDF downloads and HTML pageviews) by UVA users. The dataset includes downloads which occurred over a 10 year interval (2008 - 2017), for articles published in any year. Downloads are separated into Same Year Downloads and All Year Downloads.</p>
      <p><b>Same Year Downloads</b> - Number of article downloads by UVA users which occurred in 2017 for articles published during 2017. This is a measurement of the currency of the materials being accessed, and can help to show the relative use of current material vs. older material for a particular journal (see “All Year Downloads”). Note: the original 1Science dataset was obtained in 2018, with data through 2017.</p>
      <p><b>All Year Downloads</b> - Number of article downloads by UVA users which occurred in 2017 for articles published in any year (2008 - 2017). This gives us a sense of the overall usage by UVA users. We can compare the ratio of “Same Year Downloads” to “All Year Downloads” to gain insight into the relative importance to UVA users of current content versus older content for a particular journal.</p>
      <p><b>Publications</b> -  Number of articles published in peer-reviewed journals for which at least one author was affiliated with UVA.
      <p><b>Citations</b> - Number of references made by UVA researchers to an article from a given journal.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-center">Providers By Metric</h4>
      <p>Each journal is made available to UVA by one or more providers. The list of providers include publishers like Elsevier, Sage, and SpringerNature, but also aggregators like EBSCO and ProQuest, as well as the archive JSTOR. Some individual journals change publishers over time, or are available both through a publisher and an aggregator/archive. This means that a single journal may show up in the listing for more than one provider. There are 35 providers listed in this dataset.</p>
