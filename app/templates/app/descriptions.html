      <h3 class="mb-4">Description of Data</h3>
      
      <h4 class="my-4 text-center">General Information</h4>
      <p>Discipline - Each journal is classified as belonging to one, and only one, discipline. Disciplines were derived by our team from the original three-level classification system from 1Science/Science-Metrix using Domain-->Field-->Subfield. The original Science-Metrix classification had 6 domains, 22 fields, and 176 subfields; we have attempted to map the Fields more closely to areas of study at UVA. These resulting “Disciplines” were formed from the Fields by adding or removing Subfields. There are 20 mutually exclusive Disciplines.</p>
      <p>Interdisciplinary journals can be challenging to locate in this Discipline hierarchy; therefore, we have provided a “Which discipline is my journal in?” link under the Disciplines dropdown menu within the Journals by Discipline Tool. </p>
      <p>Provider - Each journal is made available to UVA by one or more providers (publisher, aggregator, or archive). The list of providers include publishers like Elsevier, Sage, and SpringerNature, but also aggregators like EBSCO and ProQuest, as well as the archive JSTOR. Some individual journals change publishers over time, or are available both through a publisher and an aggregator/archive. This means that a single journal may show up in the listing for more than one provider. There are 35 providers in the 1Science dataset.</p>
        

      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-center">Journals By Discipline</h4>
      <p>This tool provides a view of the usage of our collection in a specified Discipline. Select a Discipline and then view metrics available for each title assigned to that Discipline. All journals by Discipline which have at least one (1) of the chosen metric (downloads, publications, citations) are displayed. Journals which have zero (0) use for a given metric are not displayed. To see all journals by metric within a discipline (including those with zero usage), select the “Show Data in Table” view option, just below the Disciplines dropdown menu.</p>
      <h5 class="text-center my-4"><b>Metrics</b></h5>
      <p>Downloads - Individual article downloads (PDF downloads and HTML pageviews) by UVA users. The dataset includes downloads which occurred over a 10 year interval (2008 - 2017), for articles published in any year. Downloads are separated into Same Year Downloads and All Year Downloads.</p>
      <p>Same Year Downloads - Number of article downloads by UVA users which occurred in 2017 for articles published during 2017. This is a measurement of the currency of the materials being accessed, and can help to show the relative use of current material vs. older material for a particular journal (see “All Year Downloads”). Note: the original 1Science dataset was obtained in 2018, with data through 2017.</p>
      <p>All Year Downloads - Number of article downloads by UVA users which occurred in 2017 for articles published in any year (2017 and earlier). This gives us a sense of the overall usage by UVA users. We can compare the ratio of “Same Year Downloads” to “All Year Downloads” to gain insight into the relative importance to UVA users of current content versus older content for a particular journal.</p>
      <p>Publications by UVA authors -  Number of articles published in peer-reviewed journals for which at least one author was affiliated with UVA.
      <p>Citations - Number of references made by UVA researchers to an article from a given journal.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-center">Journals By Provider</h4>
      <p>This tool provides a view of each metric (Downloads, References, Citations) by each provider. The provider is the entity which provides electronic access to each journal. These metrics displayed are the aggregate total of all journals within that provider.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-center">Providers By Metric</h4>
      <p>This tool is used to compare a chosen metric across all the providers. The provider is the entity which provides electronic access to each journal. Here, you can choose a metric (downloads, publications, citations) and all journals within each discipline are aggregated to produce a total number, which is then displayed per provider.</p>
